A Native app that allows users to capture a photo of their fridge or pantry with their mobile device.  Fridge Vision then uses an image recognition to create a list of ingredients. Users are then presented with recipes that they can make with the available food items they already have.
Technologies = React Native, Knex.js, PostgreSQL, Jest, Express, Node.js, AWS3, and Clarifai
